    <p>My name is Jenan, and I am 25 years old. I was born in Saudi Arabia, and moved around the world at the age of 1.
      I have lived in the Middle East, Canada, South America, and finally settled in North America when I was 9.
      Although I've moved around to a few states, Colorado will always be home to me!</p>
      <p>I have a dog named Stitch, and he is my world!
         I was working on the Navajo reservation after I graduated college, and when he was a pup, I found him under my car.
         He was very sick, and I worked really hard to nurse him back to health. He is almost 3 now, and lives a (pretty) spoiled life.
         This is a picture of him shortly after he was found. How could you not love that face?!</p>

    <p>I graduated from CU Boulder with a degree in psychology in 2011, and thought I wanted to be a Clinical Child Neuropsychologist (quite the mouthful huh?).
    As my job experiences shifted, so did my interests. I worked as a contractor at the Google office in Boulder, and that is where my real fascination technology sparked.
    During my time there I met a woman who was also a psych major in college, and she was the one that introduced me to the field of UX, and how it is possible to combine your love of human behavior, with technology.</p>
    <p>I am very excited and eager to learn as much as I can here at gSchool. I have always been fascinated with technology, and the things that can be created with it.
      I'm sure my path will form a bit more with each experience, and my goals will shift, but for now you can read more about what I plan on doing <a href="future.html">here</a>!</p>
